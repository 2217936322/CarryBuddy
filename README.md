# CarryBuddy
 Projects of League of Legends Scripting Platform, CarryBuddy.

I am publishing my entire CarryBuddy project here for the purpose of learning. CarryBuddy was a private League of Legends hack for the past several months from 4/02/2019 to 13/07/2019. The team has decided to cease the development for the reason of lack of team's time and several other reasons, and this is my legacy.

This repository covers everything required to start a SUCCESSFUL League of Legends hack.

**WujuSan**([Github](https://github.com/axell-brendow)) - For creating CarryBuddy with me, believing in it, and made the stepping stone for the project to what it is now. I truly appreciate your hard work since the day one you've spent countless hours and many sleepless nights on this project for almost no personal gain. Credits for developing external pixel search AHK and C# SDK/Core with me. Hope you survive well at uni.

Although you haven't contributed to much of this project i still appreciate your help on the C# Pixel Search SDK, your unique ass sandbox(loved that btw) and foundational help on the internal core. Wish you all the best on your internship.(**cough cough** Why did you unfriended me XD)

**Nilrem**([Github](https://github.com/PBCOnGit)) - For helping me bringing the internal core up to the ground. I really appreciate your contributions and amount of work(i mean, most of the commits were yours xD) to put the internal core together with me and Since.
